I am a second-year Computer Science PhD student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) in [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) advised by [Dr. Mahsan Nourani](https://mahsan.page/#/About%20Me). My research interests are in Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI). My research focuses on the safe and effective integration of AI in classrooms, with a particular emphasis on supporting non-tech-savvy K-12 educators and students. I aim to ensure AI tools foster inclusive learning environments in advancing STEM education. By centering the needs of rural educators, I strive for responsible AI applications that promote educational equity and enhance outcomes for all students. Specifically, I explore the challenges of student help-seeking behaviors and overreliance on AI, investigating human-AI interaction strategies to mitigate potential harms to learning and education.

I graduated from [Arcadia University](https://www.arcadia.edu/) in 2023 with a B.S. in Data Science and a minor in Computer Science where I conducted research under [Dr. Weihong Ni](https://www.arcadia.edu/faculty-and-staff/weihong-ni/).

Outside of research, I enjoy taking indoor spin classes, cooking and baking, and taking care of my growing plant collection!
