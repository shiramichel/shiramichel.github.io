I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) in [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/). My research interests are broadly at the intersections of human-computer interaction (HCI) and artificial intelligence (AI).

I graduated from [Arcadia University](https://www.arcadia.edu/) in 2023 with a B.S. in Data Science and a minor in Computer Science where I was advised by [Dr. Ned Wolff](https://www.arcadia.edu/faculty-and-staff/ned-wolff/) and conducted research under [Dr. Weihong Ni](https://www.arcadia.edu/faculty-and-staff/weihong-ni/).

Outside of research, I enjoy taking spin and barre classes, cooking and baking, and being a plant mom!
