I am a Computer Science PhD candidate at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) in [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) and a member of the [Human-Data Interaction Team (HDI)] (https://humandatainteraction.sites.northeastern.edu/) at the [Roux Institute] (https://roux.northeastern.edu/). I am advised by [Dr. Mahsan Nourani](https://mahsan.page/#/About%20Me) and [Dr. Christo Wilson] (https://cbw.sh/). My research interests are broadly in Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) and Responsible AI within educational settings.

I graduated from [Arcadia University](https://www.arcadia.edu/) in 2023 with a B.S. in Data Science and a minor in Computer Science where I conducted research under [Dr. Weihong Ni](https://www.arcadia.edu/faculty-and-staff/weihong-ni/).

Outside of research, I enjoy taking indoor spin classes, cooking and baking, and taking care of my growing plant collection!
