I am a Computer Science PhD candidate at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) in [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) and a member of the [Human-Data Interaction Team (HDI)](https://humandatainteraction.sites.northeastern.edu/) at the [Roux Institute](https://roux.northeastern.edu/). I am advised by [Dr. Mahsan Nourani](https://mahsan.page/#/About%20Me) and [Dr. Christo Wilson](https://cbw.sh/). My interests are broadly in Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) and Responsible AI. Specifically, I research how cognitive biases manifest during people's interactions with large language models (LLMs) in help-seeking and information-seeking contexts. I aim to design and develop interventions to address these biases.

I graduated from [Arcadia University](https://www.arcadia.edu/) in 2023 with a B.S. in Data Science and a minor in Computer Science. 

I am always happy to connect with and mentor students, especially those similar to me from SLACs (small liberal arts college) or FGLI (first generation, low income) backgrounds, who are interested in research.

Outside of research, I enjoy taking indoor spin classes and pilates, cooking and baking, and taking care of my growing plant collection!
