I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student at ([Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/)) in ([Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/)). I am advised by ([Dr. Sina Fazelpour](https://sinafazelpour.com/)). My research interests are broadly in evaluating the fairness implications of AI-assisted decision-making.

I graduated from ([Arcadia University](https://www.arcadia.edu/)) in 2023 with a B.S. in Data Science and a minor in Computer Science where I was advised by [Dr. Ned Wolff](https://www.arcadia.edu/faculty-and-staff/ned-wolff/) and conducted research under [Dr. Weihong Ni](https://www.arcadia.edu/faculty-and-staff/weihong-ni/)

Outside of research, I enjoy taking spin and barre classes, cooking and baking, and being a plant mom!
