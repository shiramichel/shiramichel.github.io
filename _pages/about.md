I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student at [Northeastern University] (https://www.northeastern.edu/) in [Khoury College of Computer Sciences] (https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/). I am advised by [Professor Sina Fazelpour] (https://sinafazelpour.com/). My research interests are broadly in evaluating the fairness implications of AI-assisted decision-making.

I graduated from [Arcadia University] (https://www.arcadia.edu/) in May 2023 with a B.S. in Data Science and a minor in Computer Science where I was advised by [Professor Ned Wolff] (https://www.arcadia.edu/faculty-and-staff/ned-wolff/). 

Outside of research, I enjoy taking spin and barre classes, cooking and baking, and being a plant mom!
