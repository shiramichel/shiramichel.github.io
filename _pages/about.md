I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) in [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) advised by [Dr. Mahsan Nourani](https://mahsan.page/#/About%20Me). My research interests are in Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI). Specifically, I focus on enhancing the transparency, explainability, and fairness of AI systems. I aim to help individuals, particularly those who are non-tech savvy or lack an AI background, develop an appropriate understanding of and trust in these systems.

I graduated from [Arcadia University](https://www.arcadia.edu/) in 2023 with a B.S. in Data Science and a minor in Computer Science where I was advised by [Dr. Ned Wolff](https://www.arcadia.edu/faculty-and-staff/ned-wolff/) and conducted research under [Dr. Weihong Ni](https://www.arcadia.edu/faculty-and-staff/weihong-ni/).

Outside of research, I enjoy taking spin and barre classes, cooking and baking, and being a plant mom!
